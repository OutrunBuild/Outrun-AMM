## OutswapV1

OutswapV1 is built on UniswapV2 and includes several Blast (Layer 2)-based local improvements. Specifically, OutswapV1 introduces orETH and orUSD as intermediary tokens and makes significant improvements in liquidity provider fee management. The main features are as follows:

+ **Using orETH and orUSD as Intermediary Tokens**: OutswapV1 introduces orETH and orUSD as intermediary tokens in trading pairs. This design allows Outstake to capture native yields generated by OutswapV1, increasing the protocol's revenue. 

+ **Separation of Liquidity and Market-Making Fees**: OutswapV1 improves the management of market-making fees by separating liquidity from fee collection. This allows users to collect fees without removing liquidity, providing greater flexibility and convenience for liquidity providers.

### Why built based on UniswapV2 instead of UniswapV3?
We analyzed the trading pair data on UniswapV3 and found that the majority of trading volume is concentrated in mainstream pairs and stablecoin pairs, such as **USDT/USDC, ETH/USDT, ETH/USDC, WBTC/USDT, ETH/ETH_LST**.

Additionally, UniswapV3 requires professional position management, and for non-professional traders, the impermanent loss can be significant. Importantly, UniswapV3 is not friendly to new assets because it cannot provide stable liquidity and can lead to liquidity fragmentation. After all, when providing liquidity for a meme coin, it is difficult to determine the upper and lower bounds of the price range.

Therefore, we will launch the concentrated liquidity AMM version -- **OutswapV2**, after OutswapV1 has obtained sufficient liquidity.

### Features of OutswapV1
On OutswapV1, all activities related to ETH and USDB will use orETH and orUSD as intermediary tokens. Therefore, Outstake will capture the native yields generated by OutswapV1.

Unlike UniswapV2, where liquidity providers only receive LP fees when removing liquidity, with the fees being included in the liquidity removed, OutswapV1 separates liquidity from LP fees. Users can claim fees separately without removing liquidity, allowing for better position management. Simultaneously adapting to our FFLaunch product, which is detailed in the FFLaunch documentation.

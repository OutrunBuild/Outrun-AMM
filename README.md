## Outrun AMM

Outrun AMM is built on Uniswap v2 and includes several Blast (Layer 2)-based local improvements. The main features are as follows:

+ **Using orETH and orUSD as Intermediary Tokens**: Outrun AMM introduces orETH and orUSD as intermediary tokens in trading pairs. This design allows Outstake to capture native yields generated by OutswapV1, increasing the protocol's revenue.

+ **Separation of Liquidity and Market-Making Fees**: Outrun AMM improves the management of market-making fees by separating liquidity from fee collection. This allows users to collect fees without removing liquidity, providing greater flexibility and convenience for liquidity providers.

+ **New Fee Tiers**: All Uniswap v2 pools have a fixed swap fee of 0.3%, which results in a lack of flexibility for LPs (liquidity providers) who cannot seek different fee structures based on the assets they provide to the exchange. Outrun AMM will introduce new fee tiers for pool creators, allowing them to build different trading pools for various types of assets when launching pools on Outrun AMM.

+ **Referral Bonus Engine**: Outrun AMM is currently the only automated market maker on the market integrated with a referral bonus engine. We have redesigned the underlying code and opened the referral bonus engine to everyone, thereby increasing the composability of the protocol. The rewards for the referral bonus come from the protocol fees and do not harm the interests of LPs. At the same time, this attracts more transactions, bringing higher income to LPs.

## Why build on traditional AMM instead of concentrated liquidity AMM?

We analyzed the historical trading data of most concentrated liquidity AMMs on the market and found the following issues.

1. **Liquidity Concentration in Major Trading Pairs**
+ Major and stablecoin trading pairs attract the majority of trading volume and liquidity due to their high liquidity, low volatility, and high market demand.

+ The liquidity for these pairs is often provided by professional market makers who have significant capital and professional position management capabilities.

2. **Not favorable for non-professional market makers**
+ In concentrated liquidity AMMs, providing liquidity becomes more complex and requires professional knowledge to manage positions and price ranges. This high level of uncertainty makes it difficult for ordinary users to participate.

+ The liquidity provision curve in concentrated liquidity AMMs is not smooth and often faces the issue of unbalanced liquidity, leading to higher impermanent loss for liquidity providers (LPs), where losses can outweigh gains.

+ The dominance of professional market makers in providing liquidity reduces the level of decentralization, making it increasingly difficult for ordinary users to participate, thus blurring the lines between CEX and DEX.

3. **Unfriendly to New DEX Protocols and New Assets**
+ Concentrated liquidity AMMs have high market-making thresholds, and new protocols lack a large number of mainstream assets, making it difficult to accumulate Total Value Locked (TVL) for the protocol.

+ New assets face the problem of liquidity fragmentation on centralized liquidity AMMs. New assets often experience significant volatility, making it difficult to determine upper and lower price boundaries. This volatility can lead to sudden liquidity collapses, negatively impacting the project.

Therefore, the initial version of Outswap—Outrun AMM, is built based on the design philosophy of Uniswap v2. Only after Outrun AMM has gained sufficient liquidity will we launch the concentrated liquidity AMM version—**Outrun CLAMM**.

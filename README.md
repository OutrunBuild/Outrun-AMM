## OutswapV1

OutswapV1 is built on UniswapV2 and incorporates Blast (Layer 2) localization improvements as well as enhancements to liquidity provision fee management.

### Why built based on Uniswap V2 instead of Uniswap V3?
We analyzed the trading pair data on Uniswap V3 and found that the majority of trading volume is concentrated in mainstream pairs and stablecoin pairs, such as USDT/USDC, ETH/USDT, ETH/USDC, WBTC/USDT, and ETH/ETH_LST. Additionally, Uniswap V3 requires professional position management, and for non-professional traders, the impermanent loss can be significant. Importantly, Uniswap V3 is not friendly to new assets because it cannot provide stable liquidity and can lead to liquidity fragmentation. After all, when providing liquidity for a meme coin, it is difficult to determine the upper and lower bounds of the price range. Therefore, we will launch the concentrated liquidity AMM version -- OutswapV2, only after OutswapV1 has obtained sufficient liquidity.

### Features of OutswapV1
OutswapV1 uses RETH and RUSD from Outstake as the base tokens for exchange. On OutswapV1, all activities related to ETH and USDB will use RETH and RUSD as intermediary tokens. Therefore, Outstake will capture the native yields generated by OutswapV1.

Unlike UniswapV2, where liquidity providers only receive LP fees when removing liquidity, with the fees being included in the liquidity removed, OutswapV1 separates liquidity from LP fees. Users can claim fees separately without removing liquidity, allowing for better position management. Simultaneously adapting to our FFLaunch product, which is detailed in the FFLaunch documentation.

In the near future, we will also upgrade OutswapV1 to improve capital efficiency and reduce slippage, providing users with a smoother experience.
